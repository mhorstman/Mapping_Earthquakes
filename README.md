# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to get earthquake data from the USGS API and map those earthquakes in a format that is user friendly and customizable.  

### Resources
**Input**: USGS Earthquake & Major Earthquake JSON, Tectonic Plate Boundary JSON (from user fraxen via github)<br/>
**Software**: VSCode, Javascript, CSS, HTML<br/>
**Output**: index.html<br/>

## Results
The resulting webpage that was developed maps the all earthquakes and all major earthquakes (magnitude 4.5+) in the world over the last 7 days along with the earth's tectonic plates. The user is able to toggle which information shown on the map, as well as change the base map from satellite view to either street or light view.
